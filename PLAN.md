# UFRF Lean 4 Formalization — Master Plan

## Executive Summary

This project formalizes the Universal Field Resonance Framework (UFRF) as a
rigorous mathematical system in Lean 4 with Mathlib. The goal is to demonstrate
why deep mathematical structures like Fourier transforms, Monster Moonshine, and 
Calculus work. Physical constants and topological structure emerge dynamically as we
derive structure from a single definition: the Trinity `{-½, 0, +½}` with sum = 0.

## Architecture: Dependency Chain

Every module depends only on those above it. No circular imports.

## Proof Status Legend

Each theorem is tagged:

| Tag       | Meaning                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `✅ PROVEN`  | Compiles with no `sorry`. Verified by Lean kernel. |
| `🔧 TACTIC` | Structure compiles; `sorry` needs specific tactics. |
| `🏗️ DESIGN` | Type signature correct; proof strategy identified. |
| `🧭 AXIOM`  | Declared as `axiom` — intentional foundational postulate. |

---

## Phase-by-Phase Execution Plan

### Phase 1–4: ✅ COMPLETE

All original phases are complete. Every theorem that was marked 🔧 TACTIC or
🏗️ DESIGN has been proven. The codebase compiles with zero sorry and zero custom axioms.

## Scoped Sidecar Workstreams

The main dependency chain above remains the canonical core. Additional work
should be integrated only when it preserves the repo's existing theorem
boundaries and semantics.

- Numerization seed-prime arithmetic is now tracked as a separate arithmetic
  sidecar lane in
  [`docs/NUMERIZATION_SEED_PRIME_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`](/Users/dcharb/Documents/UFRF-Lean-V2/docs/NUMERIZATION_SEED_PRIME_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md).
  It is explicitly scoped to shifted-triangular seed/completion arithmetic near
  `PrimeSemantics` and `FineStructure`, and it does not automatically promote
  Allen, residue, projection-law, or neural-network claims into the Lean core.

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Zero Custom Axioms
The framework has zero custom Lean `axiom` declarations. The former `Axiomatics.lean` was deleted (commit 48960f9) as its axioms were trivially true and never referenced. The real foundation is Trinity.lean (a definition) + Structure13.lean (a derivation). The only hard facts are the Lean proofs themselves.

Former theorems and structures derived from this seeded space:
- `merkaba_geometric_factor` → derived from `C(4,3) = 4` (Simplex.lean)
- `sqrt_phi_REST` → derived from Kepler's Triangle (KeplerTriangle.lean)
- `toroidal_necessity` → derived as `toroidal_emergence` (Manifold.lean)
- `zero_point_isomorphism` → constructive definition (Recursion.lean)
- `dimensional_completeness` → constructive definition (Recursion.lean)

Everything is a `theorem` with a complete proof.

### 3. Import Strategy
We use specific Mathlib imports rather than bulk imports to keep compilation
fast and dependencies explicit. Each file lists exactly what it needs.

---

## How to Validate Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone or create this project
cd ufrf-lean

# 2. Fetch Mathlib (takes ~10 min first time)
lake update
lake exe cache get   # downloads prebuilt Mathlib oleans

# 3. Build everything
lake build

# 4. Check pipeline compliance
./scripts/certify.sh
```

A successful build with the pipeline checks ensures the entire proof chain is formally verified by the Lean kernel — zero sorry, zero custom axioms.

## Optimized Prompt for Continued Work

When working with an LLM to extend the formalization, use this prompt
structure for best results:

```
Context: I'm formalizing UFRF in Lean 4 with Mathlib4.

File: [paste the specific .lean file]

Target: Add theorem `[name]` proving [statement].

Constraints:
- Must compile against Mathlib4 (current toolchain)
- No new axioms — use only tactics and existing Mathlib lemmas
- Show the exact tactic proof, not pseudocode
- Zero sorry tolerance

What Mathlib lemmas are available for [specific math concept]?
Then write the complete tactic proof.
```
